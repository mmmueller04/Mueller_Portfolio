## 🗺️ GIS Projects


### 1. Habitat Protection in California (Story Map & Report)

This project analyzes the overlap between urban development, protected lands, and vulnerable habitats across California to identify areas at high risk for biodiversity loss.  

**Objectives:**
- Identify critical habitats near urban areas
- Assess gaps in protection based on access type (open, restricted, off-limits)
- Support conservation planning and ecological policy

**Tools & Skills Used:**
- ArcGIS Pro
- Buffer analysis & spatial overlays
- Story Map creation
- Environmental communication

### 2. Defining Food Deserts (Story Map)

This project explores the concept of food deserts by comparing spatial access to food across different communities. The analysis includes maps of Galesburg, IL (my college town), and Manhattan, NY.

**Map Layers & Comparisons:**
- **Galesburg Map 1**: Areas of poverty overlapped with 10-minute walk zones to the nearest grocery store.
- **Galesburg Map 2**: Low-income population, food access points, and areas within a 1-mile walk.
- **Manhattan Map**: Same layers and methodology as Galesburg Map 2 to contrast urban and rural food access.

**Project Goals:**
- Define what constitutes a food desert
- Visualize disparities in access to nutritious food
- Discuss how food deserts impact public health and equity
- Propose potential solutions to improve food access

**Tools & Skills Used:**
- ArcGIS Online
- Web-based Story Map design
- Demographic and infrastructure data analysis
- Environmental justice framing

## 🔬 Research Projects  
  
  
### 1. Summer Collaborative Research Website  

Over six weeks, a team of nine students and one professor created a website documenting our environmental site visits and projects. Highlights include a rain garden we built and planted, a concept design for a sustainable campus learning center, and insights from a forest therapy workshop. The website served as our final project, showcasing our work in an engaging and accessible format.
